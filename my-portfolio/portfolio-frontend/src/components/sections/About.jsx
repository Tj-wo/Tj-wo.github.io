        <p>
          I am a full-stack developer with a strong backend focus. I design and build
          robust APIs and services using Java and Spring Boot, and deliver polished frontends with React.
          I value clean architecture, readable code, and pragmatic solutions for production environments.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I’m not coding, I enjoy exploring software design patterns and contributing to small open-source projects.
        </p>
      </div>
    </section>
  );
